<h3>V1.98  build 457 on September 10, 2010</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Try various sample rates if ListenUp is having trouble opening an audio device. This may reduce the frequency of the rare DeviceUnavailableException.</li>
  <li>If a DeviceUnavailableException does occur then ListenUp will no longer hang. This will allow the user to upload any recording they have already made.</li>
  <li>If a USB mic is unplugged during recording then ListenUp will no longer hang.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.97 build 451 on April 12, 2010</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added &quot;Trusted-Only: true&quot; to manifest in JAR files to work around an unexpected change in Java 1.6.0_19. Sun now tries to block signed Applets from using unsigned library JAR files. Our Speex JAR was unsigned which triggered a warning and could cause the error message &quot;trusted loader attempted to load sandboxed resource&quot;. See Sun's explanation <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/mixed_code.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Our tech support forum has more details <a href="http://www.javasonics.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=330">here</a>.</li>
  <li>We now sign the &quot;OggXiphSpeexJS.jar&quot; using our digital certificate and provide &quot;OggXiphSpeexJSUnsigned.jar&quot;.</li>
  <li>Use informative message for audio device errors in more cases.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>V1.96 BETA build 447 on March 19, 2010</h3>
<ul>
  <li>New and better looking button images.</li>

  <li>Removed popup menu from PlayerApplet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.95 BETA build 444-446 last built on January 20, 2010</h3>
<h4>Fixes</h4>
<ul>

</ul>
<h4>Transcription Specific Changes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Normally ListenUp will jump to the beginning of a recording when you try to play from the end. That has been disabled for the Philips Speech Mike play button.</li>
  <li>For &quot;sendOnEOL&quot;, we now check for an empty recording before starting the countdown.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.93 build 437 August 24, 2009</h3>

  <li>Added &quot;stateChangeCallback&quot; parameter that overrides the default &quot;LUPJS_StateChanged&quot; function name. Also &quot;timeChangeCallback&quot; and &quot;levelChangeCallback&quot;.</li>
  <li>The stateChangeCallback will no longer be called when the previousState equals the newState except when the Applet is launched. Then it will be called with (&quot;stopped&quot;,&quot;stopped&quot;).</li>
  <li>Added &quot;<a href="docs/player_parameters.html">autoPreview</a>&quot; option to RecorderApplet that will rewind and play the last few seconds of audio when <strong>recording</strong> is paused.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Give user better information on how to solve DeviceUnavailableException, including &quot;close other audio applications&quot;.</li>
  <li>Prevent a user from accidentally uploading the same recording twice by double clicking on a JavaScript &quot;Send&quot; button.</li>

  <li>Minimize SpeechMike window after startup.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.92 build 423 March 10, 2009</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Workaround for <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6635462" target="_blank">Sun Java bug #6635462</a> that caused the highlighting of waveforms to draw very slowly.</li>
  <li>User no longer has to wait three seconds before clicking &quot;NEXT&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; button in free mode.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem with setAudioSelection(begin,end) not always updating the display when called from JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Added <a href="docs/script_asp.html">ASP docs</a>, an example upload script and <a href="asp_test/index.html">test section</a>.</li>
  <li>Added &quot;ignoreMissingSample&quot; so that ListenUp will fail silently if the sampleURLName is for a missing file. This was added for use in Preview operations for Drupal.</li>
  <li>Added &quot;speexComplexity&quot; parameter that can be used to control the amount of computation dedicated to compressing Speex audio. Default is 3.</li>

</ul>
<h3>V1.89 build 385, September 4, 2008</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added &quot;<a href="docs/player_parameters.html">autoBackStep</a>&quot; feature to PlayerApplet that will rewind a few seconds when playback is paused.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug introduced in V1.87 that made it impossible to upload recordings when &quot;arrangement&quot; was set to &quot;tall&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.88 build 384, August 26, 2008</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug introduced in V1.87 that caused recordings uploaded after &quot;stashBeforeSend&quot; to be empty.</li>
  <li>Added example and documentation for &quot;stashBeforeSend&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.87 build 383, August 25, 2008</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for Philips Speech Mike Classic LFH5262 and other recent models.</li>
  <li>Added use of LEDs on Speech Mikes to indicate insert or overwrite mode.</li>
  <li>Changed behavior of player. When playing to the end we now leave the cursor at the end of the recording instead of moving it to the beginning. This allows us to record at the end of the recording more easily.</li>
  <li>Added ability to save a temporary copy of a recording on the client hard drive.
    <ul>
      <li>Added &quot;stashBeforeSend&quot; parameter that will save a copy of the recording before uploading it to the server. The file is temporary and will be deleted after a few days. The number of files that can be stashed is also limited.</li>
      <li>Added &quot;Load Most Recent Recording&quot; item to popupMenu in WaveForm display.</li>
      <li>The combination of these features allows a user to recover a recording that would otherwise have been lost because of a network failure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes related to the text based time display.
    <ul>
      <li>Added &quot;putTimeOnTop&quot; parameter that puts the time display on the top row along with the buttons. This allows the waveform display to fill the entire bottom row.</li>
      <li>Added &quot;timeTextSize&quot; parameter to control the time display font size. Default is 12.</li>
      <li>Added &quot;timeTextBold&quot; parameter that  controls make the time display font bold if &quot;yes&quot;.</li>
      <li>Allow time display in PlayerApplet if showTimeText is &quot;yes&quot;. Default is &quot;no&quot; for PlayerApplet and &quot;yes&quot; for the recorders.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Enable Send button when recorder is Paused.</li>
  <li>Put WaveForm display in the CENTER of a BorderLayout so it will expand when a recorder is made bigger.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug introduced in V1.85 that caused a &quot;license file not found&quot; exception when clicking directly on ListenUp example files on disk. We no longer append a query to license URL when  testing without an HTTP server. Note that this problem did not affect people using ListenUp on the web. It only affected developers.</li>
  <li>Allow mixed case for SUCCESS, WARNING or ERROR response from &quot;uploadURL&quot; server script. ListenUp used to require upper case.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.86 build 372, May 12, 2008</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed problem with Pause jumping to beginning of the recording. The bug  was introduced in V1.84.</li>
  <li>Also fixed related problem in Transcription mode where rewinding from the very end of a recording would jump to the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.85 build 369, April 22, 2008</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add query to GET of license file so that old license files will not get stuck in proxy caches.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.84 build 368, March 10, 2008</h3>
<ul><li>Allow developers to turn off the popup error messages by setting the &quot;showErrorAlerts&quot; parameter to &quot;no&quot;. Error messages will still be written to the Java Console. Some error messages will also be written to the ListenUp Applet panel.</li>
  <li>Stop cursor at end of recording when &quot;Stop&quot; button is clicked. This makes it easier to stop then continue a recording by appending to the end.</li>
  <li>If the cursor is at the end of a recording and Play is clicked then ListenUp will automatically rewind and play from the beginning.</li>
  <li>Add a nicer looking example button Skin.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.83 build 366, December 12, 2007</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Allow customers to turn off the JavaSonics logo using showLogo=no without requiring the &quot;nologo&quot; license option.</li>
  <li>Use new PHP4 and PHP5 style $_POST instead of $HTTP_POST_VARS in PHP scripts because PHP 3 is now totally obsolete.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.82 build 363, October 12, 2007</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If  image buttons cannot be created for Record, Play, etc. then use text buttons instead. This  prevents a hang or crash on Macintosh that can occur when switching rapidly between pages that contain the ListenUp Applet. The hang is due to a bug (ID#5538401) in  Apple's Java native AWT code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.81 build 360, July 27, 2007</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added &quot;showUploader&quot; parameter that can be used to turn off the Send Button and the Status Message together.</li>
  <li>Added JavaScript callable methods:
    <ul>
      <li>setAudioSelection( startTime, endTime ) // in seconds</li>
      <li>eraseSelected()</li>
      <li> getMaxPlayableTime() // length of recording in seconds</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ERROR returned from server can now be handled by your JavaScript code by calling setUploadFailureScript(code)</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.80. build 356, July 17, 2007</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added new license model that allows free use and displays an advertisement for ListenUp. A license can be purchased to eliminate the advertisement. </li>
  <li>License file is now called &quot;listenup_license.txt&quot;.</li>
  <li>Removed &quot;credit&quot; license model.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.70, build 338, November 9, 2006</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added workaround for Java bug  that caused clicking on Record button on some rare machines to not respond. This was due to Java not calling mouseEntered() method as expected. This also fixes the problem on Mac OS X where one had to click twice to get it to record. </li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.69, build 334, November 4, 2006</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added &quot;sendButtonText&quot; parameter that can be used to change the text in the Send button.</li>
    <li>Avoid checking for the JavaSonics plugin if JavaSound will be used. This should eliminate some HTTP 404 errors caused by the JavaClassLoader looking for the &quot;SonicNativeSystem class&quot; file. </li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.68, build 333, Sept 6, 2006</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Signed JAR files with new Thawte digital certificate to fix &quot;expired certificate&quot; message. </li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.68, build 332 June 9, 2006</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added a workaround for <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6261423" target="_blank">bug #6261423 in Sun JavaSound</a> that was causing occasional audio glitches and  dropouts. This bug only affected Java 1.5 on Windows. </li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.66, build 329 April 24, 2006</h3>
<p>Several new features were added.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Designer can now disable various GUI components using parameters &quot;showPauseButton&quot;, &quot;showVUMeter&quot;, &quot;showPositionDisplay&quot;, and &quot;showTimeText&quot;.</li>
	<li>Added &quot;protectRecording&quot; parameter that will revent a recording from being erased or recorded over before being uploaded.</li>
    <li>Added &quot;useURLConnection&quot; that selects high level HTTP class over custom socket based connection. This provides better compatibility with redirection, authentication and other HTTP facilities. </li>
    <li>Added &quot;requestStateChange&quot;, &quot;requestTimeChange&quot; and &quot;requestLevelChange&quot; for building custom GUIs in JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Add &quot;timeChangeInterval&quot; to control frequency of time display update.</li>
    <li>Fixed problem with silent error if Speex JAR not specified. </li>
    <li>New SpeexToWAV utility.</li>
    <li>Improved error reporting for file downloads. Now reports original Exception.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.61, build 320 March 25, 2006</h3>
<p>This release does not contain new Applet code. It is just an update for some of the examples and documentation. </p>
<ul>
    <li> Use $_GET in &quot;php_test/play_message.php&quot; for compatibility with PHP V5.0+</li>
    <li>Use relative pathname in &quot;php_test/test_write.php&quot; for improved reliability.</li>
    <li>Misc cleanup in &quot;listenup_jsp&quot; </li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.61, build 320 March 21, 2006</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Placed Record button to left of play buttons.</li>
    <li>Allow Mac OS X users with one button mouse to use Control-left-click for deleting the selected region in the editor. </li>
    <li>Removed &quot;Test&quot; message and version info from initial  message display. </li>
    <li>Print version info in error reports.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V1.60, build 307 January 30, 2006</h3>
<p>This version introduces the new ListenUp license model.</p>
<ul>
    <li>ListenUp usage now licensed through a credit system managed on the JavaSonics server.</li>
    <li>Customers can now change the domains associated with their license using an online account.</li>

    <li>Added &quot;useTextButtons&quot; parameter for the visually impaired because screen readers cannot read image buttons. </li>
</ul>

<h3>V1.54, build 281, December 9, 2005 - re-signed with new certificate</h3>
<p>This is the same code as the August 11, 2005 release except it has been re-signed with a new Digital Certificate
